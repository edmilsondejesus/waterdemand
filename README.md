# Machine Learning Algorithm for Water Demand forecasting

## Problem

- Climatic conditions and other factors, as described by Yassuda et al. (1976 apud SILVA et al., 2008), tends to influence the demand for water, leading the system to imbalance as it accelerates the outflow of the reservoirs.

- According to Santos (2014), errors in demand forecasting increase system operating costs and increase risks in water supply.

- The inaccuracy in properly forecasting the demand for water causes several problems, such as lack of water, necessary pumping costs, increased leaks and losses in network locations.

ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·

## Motivation
- Investments in water supply infrastructure are expensive and take time to implement and return on investment (REES, 2020);
- Global warming and world population growth (DINIZ, 2019) are strong motivators for assertiveness in forecasting water demand;


## Objective

** Propose a machine learning model for forecasting RMS water demand, considering climate variables and consumption history:

- Implement and evaluate the accuracy of models for forecasting water demand;

- Establish a model that gives the best accuracy in forecasting demand
